Welcome to Athlete Forecast!
This project aims to assist collegiate football recruiters in understanding the potential fit of potential high school recruits by leveraging statistical
analysis and comparison with current college athletes.

**#Overview**  

This application allows recruiters to input recruits' height, weight, star ranking, and overall NCAA assigned rating. 
Using a sophisticated algorithm based on Euclidean mathematics and historical data, the application matches the recruit's statistics to an existing collegiate athlete 
that demonstrated similar attributes during their high school careers. 
Once the matching process is complete, the application outputs the most recent statistics of that college athlete from the
2023 NCAA season. Athlete Forecast allows scouts to be able to analyze high school recruits through direct comparison with active athletes of similar BMI and skill level.

Welcome to Athlete Forecast!
Athlete Forecast is a tool designed to revolutionize the collegiate football recruiting process. By utilizing sophisticated statistical analysis and comparison techniques, this project aims to provide recruiters with valuable insights into the potential fit of high school football recruits at the collegiate level.  

**Overview**  

Athlete Forecast allows recruiters to input various metrics such as height, weight, star ranking, and NCAA-assigned rating for potential recruits. Leveraging a cutting-edge algorithm rooted in Euclidean mathematics and historical data, the application matches these statistics with those of current college athletes who exhibited similar attributes during their high school careers. The output of this process provides recruiters with the most recent statistics of the matched college athlete from the 2023 NCAA season, facilitating direct comparison and informed decision-making. At this point in time, Athlete Forecast works only with predicting the behavior of Wide Reciever, but our goal is to soon expand its application to positions in American College Football!  

**How It Works**  

Input Stats: Recruiters provide the height, weight, star ranking, and rating data of recruits through the intuitive application interface.

Statistical Analysis: Using Euclidean mathematics and a proprietary algorithm, the application conducts a comprehensive analysis of the input data. This analysis includes a comparison with a database of historical high school football recruits and their subsequent collegiate performance.

Matching Process: Based on the analysis, Athlete Forecast identifies college athletes from the past who shared similar high school statistics with the input recruit.

Output: The application presents recruiters with the most recent statistics of college athletes from the 2023 NCAA season who closely resemble the input recruit's profile. This output empowers recruiters to assess the potential performance of incoming athletes at the collegiate level accurately.


**How to Use**  

1. Clone the Repository: Begin by cloning the Athlete Forecast repository to your local device.

2. Make sure the filepaths in the app.py file match with those on your own device.

Welcome to Athlete Forecast!
This project aims to assist collegiate football recruiters in understanding the potential fit of potential high school recruits by leveraging statistical
analysis and comparison with current college athletes.

**Overview**  

This application allows recruiters to input recruits' height, weight, star ranking, and overall NCAA assigned rating. 
Using a sophisticated algorithm based on Euclidean mathematics and historical data, the application matches the recruit's statistics to an existing collegiate athlete 
that demonstrated similar attributes during their high school careers. 
Once the matching process is complete, the application outputs the most recent statistics of that college athlete from the
2023 NCAA season. Athlete Forecast allows scouts to be able to analyze high school recruits through direct comparison with active athletes of similar BMI and skill level.

**How It Works**  

Input Stats: Recruiters provide the height, weight, star ranking, and rating data of recruits through the application interface.  

Statistical Analysis: The application utilizes Euclidean mathematics and a proprietary algorithm to analyze the input and compare it to a database of historical high school football recruits and their subsequent performance in college.  

Matching Process: Based on the analysis, the application identifies college athletes from the past who had similar high school statistics to the input.

Output: The application then presents the recruiter with the most recent statistics of college athletes from the 2023 NCAA season who closely resemble the input user's profile, helping recruiters gauge the performance of incoming athletes at the collegiate level.  

**How to Use**  

1. Clone the repository to your local device.  

2. Navigate to the project directory and open the application.  

3. Input height, weight, star ranking, and rating.  

4. Run the algorithm to find matches.  

5. Review the output to see the most recent statistics of college athletes who closely resemble the input profile.
